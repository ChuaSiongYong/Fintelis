            <h2>Do I need to pay any upfront fee?</h2>
            <p>
                There are no upfront processing fees, stamp duties, attorney fees, or 
                other charges. Please notify our Fintelis Management if any of our 
                consultants requests payment in advance. We'd report him/her to the cops 
                with you, and help the victims get justice.

            <h2>Why Fintelis donâ€™t collect upfront fee?</h2>
            <p>
                It was because there are a lot of loan frauds out there nowadays, and they 
                want you to pay a processing charge. Fintelis wants to guarantee that you 
                apply for a loan with us with ease and confidence, thus there is no upfront 
                charge. However, we do not charge a price for our services. It's only that 
                you don't pay us until you've received your bank loan.

            <h2>Then when would Fintelis start to collect fee?</h2>
            <p>
                Fintelis will only be paid when the money has been disbursed to your bank 
                account. You would not have been asked for any money prior to then.
