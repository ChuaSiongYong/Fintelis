            <p>
                Semi-Flexi Loans allows you to pay off larger sums of your 
                outstanding loan amount in advance. That means your total interest 
                is also reduced, since the principal amount on your loan has been 
                paid off, at an earlier point in time.

            <h2>Mortgage-Loan</h2>
            <p>
                A mortgage, also referred to as a mortgage loan, is an agreement 
                between you (the borrower) and a mortgage lender to buy or refinance 
                a home without having all the cash upfront. This agreement gives lenders 
                the legal rights to repossess a property if you fail to meet the terms of
                 your mortgage, most commonly by not repaying the money youâ€™ve borrowed plus 
                 interest.
