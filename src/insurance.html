                Insurance is a method of risk management. When you buy insurance, you're buying protection against 
                financial disasters. If anything horrible happens to you, the insurance company 
                compensates you or someone you pick. If you do not have insurance and an accident 
                occurs, you may be liable for all associated costs.

            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>
                A contract between an insurer and a policyholder is known as life insurance. In exchange for 
                the premiums paid by the policyholder during their lifetime, a Life Insurance policy 
                assures that the insurer will pay an amount of money to designated beneficiaries when 
                the insured dies.

            <h2>Takaful</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional insurance, where the risk is shifted from the insured to the insurer, 
                Takaful Insurance members share the risk. Takaful operations are founded on the 
                mutuality concept, in which each member makes a gift to the Takaful fund.
