            <h3>Step 1</h3>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <h2>Report Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                After obtaining your latest report, we would analyse your current 
                “credibility to the bank”.
            </p> <br>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <h2>Fact Finding Process</h2>
            <p>
                After completing the analysis of the report, our specialists would 
                first contact you by telephone to understand your current situation 
                and the problems you are facing.
            </p> <br>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <h2>Financial Advisory</h2>
            <p>
                Next, we would provide an one-to-one free consultation service to let 
                you understand comprehensively your current situation (from bank’s 
                perspective) and cater for you the most viable options. The most important 
                thing is to let you know how you could establish your own credibility.

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <h2>Agreement Confirmation</h2>
            <p>
                When you have agreed to the proposal provided by our consultant, we 
                would prepare the basic agreement between us before going into process 
                for loan submission.
            </p> <br>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <h2>Loan Submission Process</h2>
            <p>
                We would prepare a list of documents required for the loan, and help 
                you complete the documents required by the bank in the shortest time, 
                and then submit them to the bank for loan application.

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <h2>Contract Signing Process</h2>
            <p>
                After the bank had reviewed your bank’s credibility and documents, 
                if without any further justification, the bank would approve the 
                loan and have the applicant sign the letter offer by earliest within 
                7 days after the approval.
            </p> <br>

            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <h2>Bank Fund Release</h2>
            <p>
                After signing bank agreements, the next step is to wait for the bank 
                to allocate the loan. The bank would remit the loan to your bank account 
                within 3 to 6 months (subject to the type of loan applied and more 
                importantly the type of property that is cavaet.)

            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <h2>Consultant Fee Collection</h2>
            <p>
                Our consultation fee would only be levied after you receive a loan, so 
                you don’t need to pay us any fee before receiving a bank loan.
