            <p>
                To begin, please provide your full English name, IC number, and phone number so

            <h2>Report Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                We would assess your present "bankability" after receiving your most recent report.

            <h2>Fact Finding Process</h2>
            <p>
                After completing the analysis of the report, our specialists would 
                first contact you by telephone to understand your current situation 
                and the problems you are facing. After finishing the report's analysis, our experts 
                will call you to learn more about your present scenario and the issues you're having.

            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <h2>Financial Advisory</h2>
            <p>
                Following that, we would conduct a one-on-one free consultation service to help you 
                fully comprehend your present position (from the bank's perspective) and provide you 
                with the most feasible solutions. The most essential thing is for you to understand 
                how you may build your own credibility.

            <h2>Agreement Confirmation</h2>
            <p>
                After you have agreed to our consultant's suggestion, we will draught a basic agreement 
                between us before moving forward with the loan application procedure.

            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <h2>Loan Submission Process</h2>
            <p>
                We would compile a list of needed papers for the loan and assist you in completing the 
                paperwork required by the bank in the quickest period possible, before submitting them 
                to the bank for loan application.

            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <h2>Contract Signing Process</h2>
            <p>
                Following the bank has checked your bank's reputation and papers, if there is no more 
                rationale, the bank will accept the loan and have the applicant sign the letter offer 
                as soon as possible after the approval.

            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <h2>Bank Fund Release</h2>
            <p>
                The next step is to wait for the bank to distribute the loan after signing the bank 
                agreements. The bank would deposit the loan into your account within 3 to 6 months 
                (depending on the sort of loan you applied for and, more critically, the type of 
                property you own.)

            <h2>Consultant Fee Collection</h2>
            <p>
                Our consultation charge will be assessed only after you have received a loan, so you 
                will not be required to pay us anything prior to securing a bank loan.
